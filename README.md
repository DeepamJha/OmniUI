# OmniUI

**OmniUI** is a generative workspace where users describe a task in natural language and the interface dynamically assembles the required UI components in real time.

Built for the **Tambo Generative UI Hackathon**.

## 🚀 What is OmniUI?

Most AI apps return **text**.  
**OmniUI returns interfaces.**

Instead of chat messages, OmniUI generates:
- Metric cards
- Dashboards
- Status panels
- Task views

The **UI itself is the output**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

> "Describe what you need. Watch the workspace assemble itself."

OmniUI uses **Tambo's Generative UI SDK** to decide:
- which components to render
- what props to pass
- when to update the interface

All driven by natural language.

---

## ✨ Why this matters (Generative UI)

- No fixed layouts
- No hard-coded dashboards
- The UI adapts to intent, not clicks

This is **Generative UI**, not a chatbot.

## 🧪 Example Prompts

Try:
- `Show revenue metrics`
- `Display task progress`
- `Analyze system health`

Each prompt dynamically materializes UI components inside the workspace.

---

## 🎛 UI Philosophy

- Control-center / command-deck aesthetic  
- Wide, immersive workspace (no chat bubbles)
- Subtle grid + ambient background
- Motion communicates "assembly"

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Tambo**

## 📌 Status

🚧 **Hackathon build (v0.1)**

Focused on clarity, demoability, and core generative UI behavior.

More components and interactions coming soon.
